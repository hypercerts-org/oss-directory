description: 'Beans is a non-custodial payments and savings app built on Stellar.
  Most blockchain based apps have targeted the crypto community. We have taken a different
  approach and will target the general public. Inside the app all blockchain-related
  things have been abstracted away, offering a bank experience using blockchain technology!
  We are aiming to be the first app to get significant traction on blockchain payments! '
