description: 'Create a concise, neutral, no marketing, 1 liner description of the
  project from the following intro:  KIP Protocol is an open source Web3 framework
  designed to facilitate the creation, management and monetization of decentralized
  Knowledge Assets for AI applications, to kickstart KnowledgeFi. KIP Protocol empowers
  AI value-creators to connect up their expertise - whether this lies in data production,
  model training, app design or elsewhere - and enjoy transparent accounting and revenue
  shares. Under this system, each component is wrapped in an NFT or an ERC-3525 Semi-Fungible
  Token (SFT), allowing for easy, low-gas transfers of economic value between the
  components  in real time, users interact with them.    The $KIP token serves as
  an accounting unit as well as the core transaction currency of the protocol.  KIP
  Protocol comprises 3 layers:  1. Application Layer  AI apps can be deployed on KIP
  Protocol via the minting of an NFT or SFT, seamlessly linking to AI models and Knowledge
  Assets and allowing for interactions to be recorded as entries on the $KIP ledger.   2.
  Settlement Layer (Accounting Layer)  Connected apps, models and Knowledge Assets
  transfer value denominated in $KIP between each other efficiently. Technical details
  here.  3. Ownership Layer   Data & Knowledge can be stored (and encrypted) in an
  on-chain location in such a way that they can be made accessible to selected AI
  models for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) or training, but inaccessible to
  humans who may be tempted to pirate them.  Anyone may use KIP Protocol to create,
  protect and secure their own Knowledge Assets on chain.   Below is an overview of
  KIP Protocol functions:'
