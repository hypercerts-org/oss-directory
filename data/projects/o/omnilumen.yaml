description: OmniLumen is a comprehensive development environment for Stellar and
  Soroban, offering a suite of integrated tools and libraries to streamline the development
  process. OmniLumen offers a comprehensive local development suite for Stellar, similar
  to how wagmi.sh provides tools for Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) development. While
  wagmi.sh simplifies building on EVM with React hooks and CLI tools, OmniLumen delivers
  similar capabilities tailored for Stellar, including quick start, BigQuery integration,
  and local LLM integration.
