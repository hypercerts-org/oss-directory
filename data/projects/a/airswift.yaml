description: 'Airswiftâ€™s Supply Chain Financing Platform unlocks new lending channels
  in supply chains via Stellar''s new smart contract platform --- Soroban. The solution
  helps buyers optimize their working capital and provide SMEs with the funds they
  need prior to payment from the buyer, regardless of whether they have a direct relationship
  with the buyer.    The platform leverages credit from large buyers through tokenizing
  their account receivables on Stellar and fractionalizing them into smaller ones
  representing amounts owed to individual suppliers. Consequently, associated suppliers
  can obtain factoring services for a given account receivable, based on which they
  can secure advanced stablecoin loans equal to what will be owed them by the buyer.
  This process enables up to 10 suppliers associated with an account receivable to
  obtain credit lines so they can secure working capital. '
