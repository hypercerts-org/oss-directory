description: SubQuery is a leading blockchain data indexer that provides developers
  with fast, flexible, universal, and decentralised APIs for web3 projects. We empower
  developers from over 100+ ecosystems including Stellar, Ethereum, Polygon, Polkadot,
  Cosmos, Algorand, NEAR, and Avalanche with rich indexed data to allow them to build
  intuitive and immersive decentralised applications. This blockchain developer toolkit
  enables developers to focus on their core use case and front-end without wasting
  time building a custom backend for data processing activities. In the near future,
  the SubQuery Network will replicate this scalable and reliable solution in a completely
  decentralised manner.
