description: Develops a novel Soroban contract that helps to fairly manage "first
  come, first served" sales processes. SPOC aims to provide a fair solution for both
  buyers and sellers. It asks the buyer to commit to their order of a product or service
  by providing an up-front payment for it. This gives the seller a specified amount
  of time to produce or procure the pre-ordered product. The Soroban contract itself
  serves as an escrow for payments and ensures that all specified terms are followed
  by both the buyer and the seller. The payment is either unlocked for the seller
  upon successful delivery, or is refundable to (and by) the buyer when the order
  expires, and also if the seller needs to cancel orders because their fulfillment
  isn't possible anymore.
