description: SoroSplits is a set of smart contracts & interfaces to enable split transactions
  and revenue sharing across multiple parties in the Stellar ecosystem.  The core
  functionality of the smart contract will allow any assets (tokens) that exist on
  Stellar to be split in a trustless, automated, & transparent way across addresses
  and the user interface would enable all Stellar community members & projects to
  leverage the technology as a public good.  This functionality is a fundamental component
  to move the ecosystem away from off-chain counterparties and “trusted” middlemen
  to a truly decentralized contracting & payment structure.
