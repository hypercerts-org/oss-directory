description: Stellarcarbon provides transparent nature-based carbon offsetting with
  proof of retirement on Stellar and in the Verra Registry. With Stellarcarbon, anyone
  with a Stellar account can do a voluntary carbon offset that is registered both
  on-chain and off-chain. We have been building the infrastructure needed to connect
  legacy carbon markets with the new digital economy taking place on public ledgers.
  Other companies building on Stellar will be able to integrate our backend service
  into their products and services, to give users easy access to carbon offsets. On
  top of this infrastructure, Stellarcarbon itself wants to develop and launch a retail
  shop for carbon offsetting aimed at individuals and businesses.
